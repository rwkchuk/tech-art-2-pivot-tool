# tech-art-2-pivot-tool
this is the py file for the tech art 2 artist proof tool assignment

This tool ensures the selected meshes export to fbx with the desired pivot point for use in UE4. It was made for an assignment with
  the only requirments being the tool had to be artist proof. The idea for the tool came about from talking to several enviromnet
  artists at the time.
